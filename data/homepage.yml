    - title : "Distributed Data Environment"
      content : "We help organizations and networks manage data.  You can build your own network,
       establishing custom concepts and rules for member teams and projects.   Teams define customized
       rules that build on network rules and creating an environment for team members to interact.   An example
       network would be a monitoring network for genomic biodiversity.  Core rules are established for the
       network, and independent teams can form within the network with expanded rules. In this scenario, teams would be:
       'Fish Sampling Team', 'Environmental DNA Team', and 'Fossil Traits Team'.  Each of these teams would
       have unique attributes and rules regarding their type of data, while enabling broader network 
       integration.
       
       Our distributed data environment is fully customizable using JSON objects to define network and team
       behaviour."

      title : "High-throughput ontology-based pipeline (ontology-data-pipeline)"
      content : "Ontologies help in data integration by using a logic-based framework to define relationships
      between entities.  Ontologies are a powerful tool, but often users
      are presented with the challenge of using ontologies effectively in data management.  
      We have built a flexible, scalable pipeline for integration and alignment of multiple data sources 
      using ontologies. 
      Processing is adaptable to all kinds of data or reasoning profiles, and 
      output is compatible with any type of storage technology. The ontology-data-pipeline is designed to 
      be run as a Docker container but can also be run natively in python. For more information visit the
      [ontology-data-pipeline github page](https://github.com/biocodellc/ontology-data-pipeline)."

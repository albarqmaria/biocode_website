      content : "We help organizations and networks manage and improve data.  Using our open source tools, you can build your own network,
       consisting of teams and projects.  The network defines core data standards and concepts. Teams build on network
       rules while creating an environment for individual members to interact and contribute data.  
       Our tools are built to be adaptable to many different types of data.
       One example network is the Genomics Observatory Metadatabase, listed under projects below."

      image : "images/pipeline.png"
      content : "Ontologies help in data integration by using a logic-based framework to define relationships
      between entities.  Ontologies are a powerful tool, but often users
      are presented with the challenge of using ontologies effectively in data management.  
      We have built a flexible, scalable pipeline for integration and alignment of multiple data sources 
      using ontologies. 
      Processing is adaptable to all kinds of data or reasoning profiles, and 
      output is compatible with any type of storage technology. The ontology-data-pipeline is designed to 
      be run as a Docker container but can also be run natively in python. For more information visit the
      [ontology-data-pipeline github page](https://github.com/biocodellc/ontology-data-pipeline)."
